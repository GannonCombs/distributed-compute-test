Steps:


Activate the virtual environment - 
.\venv\Scripts\activate
(this needs to be done in the client terminal and the server terminal)

In one terminal, run - 
python http_server.py

In the other - 
python client.py


Explanation:

We are now registering our devices to be used for computation.

Important note:
Here I have a client and server, but this is looking at it from the other end as the previous three examples. In my case, a client is a device that wishes to sign up to donate its computation. The http server is a registration device. So in a sense:
client (example4) = server (example3)
server (example4) = load balancer (example3)
