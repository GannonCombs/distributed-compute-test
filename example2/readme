Steps:

In 3 separate terminals run - 
python server.py 10001
python server.py 10002
python server.py 10003

Run python load_balancer.py
Run python client.py
Enter integers one by one and press Enter.


Explanation:
This example gets a little more interesting. What if we want to send our data to multiple servers to compute? Here we load 3 identical servers. We also create a load balancer, which takes the data from client, and passes it round robin style across the 3 servers. We also add some code to Ctrl+C out of the servers and load balancer.
